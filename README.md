# Student Management System

## üìñ Project Overview

This is a full-stack **Student Management System** that allows users to:

- Register students  
- Enroll them in courses  
- Track grades and enrollment status  

The system uses:
- **Java** for backend processing  
- **MySQL** for database management  
- **Node.js/Express** for API handling and routing  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

You can clone this repository using Git:


Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

---

### 2. Install Required Software

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)  
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

1. Open your MySQL client (Workbench or command line).  
2. Create a base database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE studentDB;
```
(You can use a different name, but you must update it in your code accordingly.)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Update MySQL credentials in the following files:

### In Java (`StudentManagementSystemInitializer.java`):

```java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_management_system_"; //adjust db name to your choice
String user = "root";
String password = "yourPassword";
```

### In Node.js (`server.js`):

```javascript
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "root",
  password: "yourPassword",
  database: "student_management_system"
});
```

---

##  Running the Project

### 1. Install Node.js Dependencies

In the root of your project directory, open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install express cors mysql2
```

Then start the Node server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

### 2. Run the Java Backend

Open and run `StudentManagementSystemInitializer.java` 
This will initialize the connection and prepare backend services.

---

### 3. Launch the Frontend

You can open `titlePage.html` directly in your browser or run it using a Live Server extension in VS Code.

If your Express server is serving frontend files, go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

##  Dependencies

- **Java 17 or later**  
- **Node.js 16 or later**  
- **MySQL Server**  
- **npm packages:**  
  - `express`  
  - `cors`  
  - `mysql2`  

---

##  Notes

- Ensure MySQL is running and the database is created before running any Java or Node code.  
- Double-check that you updated your MySQL credentials in both the Java and JavaScript files.  
- You may need to manually create tables if not automatically generated by your Java classes.  

---

##  Next Steps

- Implement table creation scripts if not present  
- Add validation and error-handling on both backend and frontend  
- Expand UI features for student profiles, course search, and real-time updates
